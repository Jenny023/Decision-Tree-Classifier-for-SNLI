This page contains the adjusted code of L. Abzianidze, written by group 9 of the Logic and Language Course 2024-2025 (Aniek, Anne and Jennifer)

This project explores feature-based approaches for Natural Language Inference (NLI), by using the Scikit-Learn decision tree classifier. 
Two types of features, smart and shallow, are extracted in various methods. Some make use of spaCy and WordNet among other PythonÂ libraries.
